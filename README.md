# Machine Learning for Treatment Therapies

## Project Objective
The final goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive prediction model for Cystic Fibrosis modulators and provide clinical insight into the current therapies. In terms of the data science perspective, the project covers the entire data science pipeline/workflow. The main tasks include the following steps: 

- Collect physiological datasets from over 100 clinical trials at Johns Hopkins Hospital (we ran over 3 years)
- Perform data cleansing (peaks/outliers removal, data filtering)
- Exploratory data analysis, data visualization
- Build machine learning models 
- Interpret data and provide clinical recommendation based on predictive models for treatment therapies to improve the health status of patients
- Write final reports, presentations (e.g., RMarkdown, LATEX, Shiny)

## Progress
- On-going project with two Johns Hopkins undergrads and one Ph.D. student
- The current step is performing data exploratory and visualization
- Tools used: mostly in R (e.g., tidyverse, ggplot2), MATLAB
- The progress will be updated weekly
